### D. Research Experience
__Postgraduate student: Artificial Intelligence Course__
- Case study research on a banking institution dataset to determine the accuracy of the classification of clients who have subscribed to deposits compared to those who have not subscribed to deposits using Support Vector Machines (SVM).
- Reinforcement Learning Case Study Research for 
restaurants to carry out different promotional programs in order to attract customers & gain more profit. From this research, the Restaurant Management can find out how changes in weekly promotional programs can provide great benefits (considering program discounts, shipping discounts, discounts, buying savings packages, & cashback), profit after discounts, & total customers.
- Case study research on the dataset of most frequently detected food items in food applications and use it to evaluate the recognition performance. The purpose of the study is to detect and recognize food images through parameter optimization using the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithm.
- Clustering Case Study Research on a dataset to develop a clustering model that can classify countries well in terms of the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases using unsupervised machine learning algorithms (k-means).
- Case study research on a dataset of COVID-19 clinical symptoms used to classify people with COVID-19 using Decision Tree.
- Case study research on an Animal Shelter dataset. The research was conducted using Decision Tree to help Animal Shelter management in predicting outcome 
results (whether the animal is Adopted / Died / Disposal / Euthanasia / Missing / Return to Owner / Return to Adopt / Transfer) based on the animal's intake background (Fertilization & Age). With this Decision Tree, it is hoped that Animal Shelters will focus more of their energy on improving sterilization programs to increase adoption rates & avoid euthanasia.

__Postgraduate student: Multivariate Statistic Course__
- Case study research on a dataset to find out something as a cause of something else using Structural Equation Model (SEM).
- Case study research on a dataset to determine the 
differences between >= 2 groups/classifications on the dependent variable using Discriminant Analysis.
- Case study research on a dataset regarding the 
relationship structure (in the form of factors) between many variables using Factor Analysis (Exploratory Factor Analysis & Confirmatory Factor Analysis).
